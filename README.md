# Starbound Workshop Exporter
 Exports all your workshop mods to a folder, and names them apropriately

First version is probably a bit buggy since i threw this whole program together in a few hours, but it should overall work fine. just start the program, select the location of starbound's workshop folder, and the program should do the rest.

TLDR it copies all .pak files from the workshop folders into one folder and renames them with either their mod IDs, or their names if steamcommunity.com is accessible.
